# Sketches

## Motivation

I have followed generative artists like [Ben Kovach](https://bendotk.com/) and [Tyler Hobbs](https://tylerxhobbs.com/work) for a while, and their artwork is truly impressive. Check them out! Similarly, the [/r/generative](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative) community produces some stunning artwork! I encourage everyone who codes to try out some generative art programming, and this project is my own exploration of creating generative art. I also used this as an opportunity to feel more comfortable with Rust and to try and make something cool. As a result, my code is quite ugly and explorative; you will see lots of commented out and unoptmized code - sorry!

The subfolders featured in this project are each individual sketches written in Rust and use the nannou project for drawing.

To run a particular sketch, simply run `cargo run --release -p <sketch_name>`, like: `cargo run --release -p cells`.

## Result

While these sketches don't come close to the level of quality shown by some of the generative artists out there, I never expect it to! Despite that, I was still able explore a couple of generative art techniques like flow fields, weighted color palettes, mesh generation and animation. I was also able to build my understanding of the Rust language in a really fun way - art!

Without further ado, here are some pieces that my code and I produced:
